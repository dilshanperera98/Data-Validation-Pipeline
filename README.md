Project Description: Automated Data Validation Pipeline

Project Overview
I am building an end-to-end automated data validation system that ensures the quality and integrity of Excel (.xlsx) files using CI/CD principles. This project combines GitHub Actions for workflow automation and Python for data validation logic, providing a robust solution to catch data issues early in the pipeline.

Key Objectives
✅ Automate Validation: Trigger checks on code changes, manual requests, or a daily schedule.
✅ Ensure Data Integrity: Validate Excel file structure and content programmatically.
✅ Generate Actionable Reports: Create human-readable reports for data quality issues.
✅ Fail Safely: Halt pipelines and notify teams on critical data issues.
✅ Integrate with DevOps: Embed data quality checks into standard development workflows.

Core Features : 
Feature	                   Description
Dual File Validation	     Checks both ZIP structure and Excel readability using openpyxl
Missing Value Analysis	   Flags columns with >10% missing data (configurable)
Automated Reports	         Generates Excel + text reports with metrics
GitHub Integration	       Triggers on pushes/PRs, stores reports as artifacts
Smart Notifications	       Creates GitHub issues on validation failure
Self-Healing Setup	       Auto-generates test data if missing

Problem Solved
Traditional data validation often involves:

❌ Manual Excel checks
❌ No version control for data quality rules
❌ Delayed discovery of data issues

Your Solution Addresses:
✅ Automated structural + statistical validation
✅ Audit trail via GitHub Actions
✅ Early detection of corrupted/incomplete data
✅ Scalable validation framework

Key Benefits :
✅ Early Issue Detection: Catch problems before analysis
✅ Audit Trail: All validations logged via GitHub Actions
✅ Consistency: Same checks run locally and in CI/CD
✅ Cost Reduction: Automate repetitive validation tasks
✅ Scalability: Easy to add new validation rules
